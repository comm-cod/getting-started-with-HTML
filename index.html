    <h2>Purpose of comments in HTML</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of comments in HTML is to explain your code, which will help
      you or others to edit the source code at a later date.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Example of how to use comments :-</h3>
    <p>
      To leave a comment in HTML, place a < !-- tag before the code and a -- >
      tag after the codee that you want to hide.

    <h2>a short note on Tag and Element with an Example</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Tag :-</b> a tag is a piece of markup language used to indicate the
      beginning and end of an HTML element in an HTML document.
      <br />
      For example: <span>&#60;</span>h1<span>&#62;</span> and
      <span>&#60;</span>/h1<span>&#62;</span> are two tags indicating beginning
      and ending of a h1 tag.
      <br />
      <b>Element :-</b> An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the
      element contains other content, it ends with a closing tag.
      <br />
      For example: < p> is starting tag of a paragraph and < /p> is closing tag
      of the same paragraph but < p>This is paragraph< /p> is a paragraph
      element.
    </p>

    <h2>What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?</h2>
    <p>
      The HTML document type declaration, also known as DOCTYPE , is the first
      line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document. The DOCTYPE
      declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of
      HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the
      same way by different web browsers.
